		<p style="font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 16pt;">
			Picocon 30 will be held on Saturday 16th February 2013,
			in Imperial College Union.
		</p>

		<h2>What is Picocon?</h2>
		<p>
			Picocon is the annual one-day Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy convention
			run by the Imperial College Science Fiction and Fantasy Society, ICSF.
			It usually takes place on a Saturday in February, in Imperial
			College's Student Union.
			We try not to clash with other conventions around the same time.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is a small (hence the name), affordable and convenient convention
			for students and fans in or near London.
			Registration opens at 10am, with the first scheduled events kicking
			off at around 10:30.
			The schedule concludes in the evening.

			At a Picocon you will encounter:

		    <ul>
				<li>Guests of Honour doing talks and panels</li>
				<li>The Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise, typically using liquid nitrogen and an enormous hammer. (You're welcome to bring along donations!)</li>
				<li>Multiplayer LAN gaming</li>
				<li>Stalls selling books, ICSF t-shirts, and other stuff</li>
				<li>Quiz and silly games</li>
				<li>Student Union bar</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<a name="#directions"><h2>Directions to Picocon</h2></a>
		<p>
			Here's a general <a href="http://g.co/maps/7ahv7">map</a> of the
			area, pointing at the entrance to Beit Quad (which houses the
			Union) off Prince Consort Road.
		</p>
		<p>
			The easiest way to get to Picocon is by tube; both Gloucester
			Road Station and South Kensington Station are within easy reach;
			for your convenience, these maps shoe the routes we suggest from
			both <a href="http://g.co/maps/ne7kr">Gloucester Road Station</a>
			and from <a href="http://g.co/maps/akrjw">South Kensington Station</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The buses C1, 9, 10, 49, 52, 70, 74, 345, 360, 414 and 452 all stop nearby.
			Please look <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/gettingaround/maps/buses/pdf/royalalberthall-12445.pdf">here</a>
			for the bus stops around the Royal Albert Hall (which is <i>literally</i>
			next door to the Union) or <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/gettingaround/maps/buses/pdf/southkensington-2236.pdf">here</a>
			for the bus stops around South Kensington Station.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Important Advice:</b> If you get lost around South
			Kensington trying to find Beit Quad, ask for directions to the
			Royal Albert Hall, and once there, Beit Quad is the building
			on the left of the RAH as you face it's main entrance
			(if you arrive form the Hyde Park side, you will be at the
			rear of the RAH).
