<p>The ICSF Quotes List contains perfectly innocent things said by people in the library. These are from 2005 or thereabouts, typed up by <a href="../../php/bio.php?biouser=Kvetch">Kvetch</a>.</p>

<p><i>The first batch (from internal evidence, from the summer holidays to the end of October 2005 - but since I wasn't around for the beginning, I can't say accurately)</i><br>
<br>

Vicky: It's the little things in life that give me pleasure.</p>
<p>Cristina: Let's see how low my price can get.<br>
<br>
Ben: There's Mellon in everyone.</p>
<p>Alex: Ian has a surplus nut.</p>
<p>Ben: Ah, yes, the Wrist-Master 2000.</p>
<p>Mark: Sliced bread is the best thing since inbred.</p>
<p>Baz: Okay, but Ben doesn't have a trench I can fly down.</p>
<p>Kath: We need more inbreeding.</p>

<p>Simon: I am not a zombie.</p>
<p>Ernst: Pull it out and let us have a look.</p>
<p>Baz: I can probably last for a couple of days, though i wouldn't particularly 
want to.</p>
<p>Baz: That's a point, where did my nuts go?</p>
<p>Phil: My overly extended silly.</p>
<p>Phil: I'm speeding away in the rear!</p>
<p>Steve: A decompressed penis is no fun for anyone.</p>
<p>Phil: Damn you Ben and your massive mound!</p>
<p>Ben: He's a boy they look like girls.</p>

<p>Ben: Physics were different in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Alex: You get a cursed thingy.<br>
Ben: But she doesn't have a thingy.</p>
<p>Ian: My genitals exploded.</p>
<p>Owlbeard the Black: Women play boys in pantomimes. They remind us of boys.<br>
Ernst: Yes. That's why we sleep with women.</p>
<p>Mark: I want a man, but I can't get one.</p>
<p>Malc: The Milky Bar Kid wasn't strong or tough enough for me!</p>
<p>Simon: The Balrog was hard, but I was great!</p>

<p>Baz: He opened himself up to it.</p>
<p>Ben: Gimli seems to have this strange ability, he only gets hard when there's 
elves around!</p>
<p>Mark: There has to be a rule that the winner gets poked...</p>
<p>Alex: If he had a 5&frac14;&quot; floppy, that would be 
cool.</p>
<p>Simon: Hyenas are not the biggest flaw in the 
D20 system.</p>
<p>Tim: That's not a bad looking cyclops.</p>
<p>Adam (to Ernst): You fuck animals.<br>

Ernst (to Adam): You fuck French people.</p>
<p>(Tiny) Tom: I walk into the library, I blow 
someone.</p>
<p>Steve: Baz, I need you shaved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Kath: Kangaroos can keep it up for hours and hours. Where &quot;it&quot; is 
defined as bouncing.</p>
<p>Robbie: I think Ben's meat beats all of ours.</p>
<p>Alex: MAGE should not stand for Mobile Ambulatory Gun Emplacement!</p>
<p>Steve: Gaffa tape is my sticky lord.</p>

<p>Cristina: Spanish has no word for &quot;Lemming&quot;. <br>
(NB: the word is unclear.&nbsp; It seems most likely to be lemming, but I read 
it originally as &quot;lemon&quot;.&nbsp; This was slightly funnier)</p>
<p>Smithers: Erotic ... arsehole?<br>
Vicky: No, I said neurotic.<br>
Smithers: Oh.</p>

<p>Smithers: I bought Photoshop - I'm law-abiding.</p>
<p>Anon: Monkeys? We don't need no steenking monkeys.</p>
<p>Ernst: Valiant wasn't good enough to be considered bad.</p>
<p>Dave (Clements): I really like the vampire episode in Buffy.</p>
<p>Kath: If Ian had longer hair he'd be tossing it over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Robbie: The power of the 10ft air &amp; concrete firewall.<br>
(NB: that was even *more* unclear)</p>
<p>Steve: Thankfully, Chutney is viscous.</p>

<p>Steve: One of my opp... players, not opponents at all...</p>
<p>Alex: Steve, at some point you will stab yourself in the balls and I will not 
be held responsible.</p>
<p>Ernst: One does not simply <i>walk</i> into Birmingham.</p>
<p>Dave: Oh no, I've got Jesus all over me now!</p>
<p>Dave: I wish I could have Jayne's mum!</p>
<p>Alex: Dude, I want to diffract Jesus.<br>
Mark: Get in line.<br>

<i>(NB: proof of the diffractability of Jesus - Jesus is both god and man at the 
same time. This is like the wave-particle duality. Therefore you can diffract 
Jesus)</i></p>
<p>Mark (to Gwen): Where's your sense of ... meat?</p>
<p>Ian: Sometimes its better to light yourself than curse the darkness.</p>
<p>Mark: Aaargh! My sperm...!<br>
<i>(NB: I know leaving the context in is considered to spoil it, but this was in 
response to a scene in Flash Gordon, where someone's concealed weapon was vaporised 
through their clothing. NB2: Note to self: What sounds perfectly fine at 
midnight sounds bad in the cold cold light of day.)</i></p>
<p>Cristina: It was about this big [holds hands about a foot apart] both inside 
and out<br>
<i>(Referring to the rip in one of the library beanbags, actually)</i></p>
<p>Dave: Are you sure you're not a statistical aberration.</p>
<p>Alex: Ben is three times better than Jesus!<br>

<i>(because he was resurrected faster, and I have to put *this* comment in, because 
I've had to tell three people why, and had to ask myself)</i></p>
<p>Ed: We should start another religion.<br>
Baz: But, we've already got, like, six.</p>
<p>Ben: I can't do it with a laptop in my lap.</p>
<p>Vicky: Girls get off a lot easier.</p>
<p>Phil: Jesus, Ben, my head is big, but yours is just unnatural.</p>
<p>Peter: I'm right into squid porn.</p>
<p>Ben: Ed made a good suggestion<br>
<i>(It may not be a pithy quote, but it is worthy of commemoration.&nbsp; However, 
reality is scabbing over the rent in space-time Ed's suggestion caused, and I 
cannot remember *what* Ed's good suggestion was)</i></p>

<p>Malc: Vegetarians are a food group!</p>
<p>Kath: Gotta catch 'em all!</p>
