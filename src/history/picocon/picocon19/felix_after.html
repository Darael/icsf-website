<h2>Picocon '02 - Stay In The Light</h2>
<h3>by <a href="../../../php/bio.php?biouser=Alia">Alia Sheikh</a></h3>

<p><i>A report on Picocon 19, which appeared in Felix issue 1257, Friday, 14th February 2003</i></p>

<p>"Killer?" I blink quietly at the bright-eyed thing behind the admissions desk and peer at the rows of badges in front of him. They range from Jessica Rabbit to Pinhead.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you pick a character and we give you a target and you kill them."</p>

<p>This wasn't quite what I'd expected when I'd decided to leave my nice warm bed and spend the day at Picocon 2002, the sci-fi society's annual convention. Then I spot the assorted weapons leaning against the wall.</p>

<p>"OK cool, can I be Elmo?"</p>

<p>So, sword slung casually over one shoulder and the name of my target in hand I wander in to face the assorted movie buffs, LAN gamers and occasional hard core sci-fi nut that the event traditionally attracts. Maybe it isn't a very traditional year 'cos I swear I can see a two year old clambering around the keyboards and a sulky 13 year old being dragged about by what looks like a rock band.</p>

<p>This lot have completely taken over the top three floors of the Union building; the Main Dining Hall is filled with computers and people with a somewhat frenzied look in their eyes madly going clickety-click. One kid is actually muttering "Die! Die!" under his breath and the reflection in his glasses shows one of the gorier scenes of Unreal Tournament.</p>

<p>LAN Gaming. I back out of there quietly.</p>

<p>There's a couple of people lugging an extremely shiny canister; white smoke flows out of it and trails down the stairs behind them. "Michael's doing the DoDM, are you coming?"</p>

<p>DoDM? Yeah, why not? It seems they're holding some kind of auction and I immediately get roped into assisting. Any questions I have about why any sane person would want a plastic Anakin Skywalker figurine are promptly answered when the winner is ceremonially handed a sledgehammer and proceeds to quite joyfully beat the crap out of Anakin.</p>

<p>The gym is comparatively more sane - there are hundreds of sci-fi books and stalls and people selling 'Don't Panic' T-shirts. I spot a mournful looking chap prodding a pair of daleks hopefully. One of my memories from the Picocon the year before was racing two large, extremely drunk looking daleks until the batteries went. It doesn't look like they're going anywhere today though so I tramp down to the quad to find the other jugglers.</p>

<p>Our wonderful fire juggling gets rudely interrupted by some idiot whacking me over the head with something and declaring "You're dead!"</p>

<p>Killed by a coaster. I've never been so embarrassed in all my life.</p>

<p>I realize at this point I've missed China Mieville's talk - as far as I can make out he's a cross between the boy you don't want to take home to meet the parents, an artist with something of a dark side and a respected sci-fi author to boot. Apparently he packed the place out too. Damn, damn, damn!</p>

<p>Ah well, at least I completely approve of the film they're showing - Pitch Black. 'Course the only reason I'd watch Vin Diesel in a shameless B flick is for those truly funky silver contacts. The rest of the day revolves around surviving a very evil quiz, nabbing a chunk of the birthday cake and at one point or another watching almost everyone threaten to kill the sulky 13 year old.</p>

<p>All in all a somewhat bizarre day. I leave the others to the business of taking the authors to dinner and wander off to the station. The people on the train seem somewhat distracted and it's not until I get home that I realize I'm still wearing a badge that proudly declares "I am Elmo".</p>
