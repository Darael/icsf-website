<h2 class="bodyDark">Picocon 2002 - John's Sofa Report</h2>

<p class="flavour">...the buck stops here...</p>

<p>
This was my second Picocon as Sofa. Last year was a bit of a trial by fire, so I had lots of good resolutions for things to do better this time around, with the benefit of experience. In particular, I wanted to get everything sorted out a lot earlier. Yes, well... Looking back on this year, I think there are a lot of things I could have done better, but all in all I think it went well.
</p>

<p>
Although I didn't contact authors as early as I'd intended, we were able to line up four excellent Guests of Honour this year, including Geoff Ryman, who was unable to attend last year. This year I managed not to lose any of them, which is always a good thing! Unfortunately, China Mi&#x00E9;ville wasn't feeling very well, so he wasn't able to stay for the dinner in the evening, but it was very good of him to come despite that, and I know that his talk was very popular.
</p>

<p>
On the day itself, I was able to get there right at the start, since my flatmates were able to load up the minibus with the various computer equipment. Again, this was a definite improvement over last year, and meant that I was able to make myself more useful in the setting up stages. Another difference from last year was that I wasn't directly in charge of any of the individual events (last year I moderated the panel discussion and read out the questions in the pub quiz). This wasn't deliberate, but it actually worked out very well, since this freed me up to roam around during the day, and  go wherever I was needed. I'd recommend this for all future sofas - delegate the individual events to other people.
</p>

<p>
Lots of the individual events seem to be evolving each year, and running more smoothly as we get the benefit of experience. For instance, the LAN (ably run by Michael and Michelle) was the biggest yet, and I'm told that it was much easier to set it up when we used a switch/RJ45 rather than chaining the PCs together with BNC. Similarly, Lorna did sterling work on the front desk, including setting up laptops for people to enter their registration details.
</p>

<p>
Killer went well, after an initially slow start, and we have apparently indoctrinated a new junior member into Fandom - the master plan is progressing on schedule... Special thanks to Michael and Lorna for their late nights sorting out images to use for the players.
</p>

<p>
Moving on to the GoH talks, I was pleasantly suprised at how well attended they were. In the morning, we decided not to set up all the chairs, to avoid the embarassment of having two rows of people sitting at the front, with loads of empty seats behind them. It then turned out that people were sitting in the floor in Geoff Ryman's session, so I hastily recruited the nearest ICSF members (ta Viv/Lloyd!) to help me set up some more rows in the break before the next talk. I think we must have had at least 100 people at each talk. We had a slight hiccup early in the day when Lloyd was hijacked to hunt baby clothes, so wasn't able to introduce China's session, but Jakob did a superb job of filling in on short notice, in addition to handling the talks in the afternoon. We did have a slight problem when the afternoon events fell behind schedule, but Stan Nicholls and Anne Gay were very accommodating about amalgamating their presentation into the panel discussion.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, the film in the evening had a lot fewer people watching it than I'd expected - probably about 20. I don't think this was a problem with the film itself (Pitch Black), just that it was unfortunately timed against the DVD release. The general concensus afterwords is that we should go for a relatively old film, that looks good on the big screen, and which people don't mind watching again.
</p>

<p>
The pub quiz was very successful, under Peter's skilled supervision. We actually managed to get all the questions sorted out at least a week before Picocon, which must be some kind of record. There was some confusion when a few questions were skipped (to save time), but it's good to give our members something to heckle about - keeps them happy... At the end of the quiz, we were able to round up multiple ex-chairs to join Jakob in cutting our birthday cake; thanks to Jo and Lorna for your baking efforts there, which were clearly well received!
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, we were able to clean up in record time, thanks to lots of willing helpers. Also, Ed and Pete were able to get all the computer equipment delivered back to the various flats, and get back by the end of the film. Cheers for the effort guys - your work may not be very visible, but it's definitely appreciated. We then all went off to two post-convention meals, since we would have been overflowing in one restaurant. These both went well, and the authors certainly enjoyed themselves.
</p>

<p>
So, now that it's all over, time to start planning for next year (honest!)...
