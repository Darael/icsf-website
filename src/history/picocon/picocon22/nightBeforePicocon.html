<h2 class="bodyDark">The Night Before Picocon</h2>
<h3>by <a href="../../../php/bio.php?biouser=gaspode">Robbie Bain</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<br />'Twas the night before Picocon, when all through the house
<br />Not a person was stirring, (well, maybe the Mouse)
<br />
<br />The planning was hatched with the utmost attention
<br />In hopes that there'd be a successful convention
<br />
<br />The committee were nestled all snug in their beds
<br />Dreams of authors and chaos danced round in their heads
<br />
<br />The chairentity, vice and the sofa as well
<br />Were settling down for a rest they'd earned well
<br />
<br />Out in the quad there would be such a scene
<br />With duelling and sea-bass and maybe sardines
<br />
<br />Until one assailant could rightly intone
<br />4 winn0r 1s m3, j00 4r3 t0t411y 0wn3d.
<br />
<br />But prior to duelling, before all that mess
<br />A thousand and one wondrous things must progress
<br />
<br />Each in its place and so carefully planned
<br />By committee and freshers and Ali's command
<br />
<br />Before registration, at eight in the morning
<br />The committee will gather and stifle their yawning
<br />
<br />With donuts or muffins or maybe some cookies
<br />And set up the tables and chairs and the wookiees
<br />
<br />Well, maybe not wookiees, (except perhaps Phil)
<br />But there's lots to be done and they're carefully drilled
<br />
<br />More rapid than eagles their efforts will be
<br />As they dash back and forth at behest of Ali
<br />
<br />Now, Simon! Now, Alex! Now, Ben and small Tom!
<br />On, Jakob! On, Michael! On, Ian and Malcolm
<br />
<br />On they will toil until doors they will open
<br />And "Welcome to Picocon" proudly is spoken
<br />
<br />The day will be varied; the programme diverse
<br />With authors and panels and games to immerse
<br />
<br />All the masses of people who come to IC
<br />For randomness, authors and festivity
<br />
<br />We've got Brian Stableford and Gwyneth Jones too
<br />And Jon Courtenay Grimwood to fill up our pews
<br />
<br />With fandom's massed hordes from all over the town
<br />Come to listen and heckle and throw some pints down
<br />
<br />In no time at all there's a prandial hiatus
<br />For which we all wait with ill-hidden impatience
<br />
<br />Since once we have paused for the breaking of bread
<br />This can mean but one thing - for Barney it's dread
<br />
<br />For the audience is cheering for our introduction
<br />Of merchandise dodgy scheduled for destruction
<br />
<br />There's liquid N<sub>2</sub> and a big rubber hammer
<br />And a ghost of Kenobi for whose death we will clamour
<br />
<br />Where's your Force now, you cheap plastic tat?
<br />Take that, and then this and then finally THAT!
<br />
<br />And later some panels and then silly games
<br />But we close with a quiz and some spurious claims
<br />
<br />Of unfairness and bias which we always ignore
<br />Until fandom and authors have all found the door
<br />
<br />And once we've sat down and the crowds have dispersed
<br />The con's at an end - which is much like this verse
<br />
<br />We all find our way out for much-needed repast
<br />Saying "Never again - this year is my last!"
<br />
