			<h3>Sci Fi</h3>

			<p>
				As Picocon 4 approaches, it brings to me happy memories of
				Picocon 1. I've never quite been sure just what made Picocon 1
				so special, maybe it was the way Mike Morcock just dropped in,
				or Christopher Tolkien sent us an original one of his father's
				doodles by way of an apology for his absence. It did look,
				though, as if there was a large dirty rain cloud in our silver
				lining, but Harry Harrison didn't turn up in the end (he was
				too busy ripping Stanislav Leon off at the time, I suppose, in
				his soon to be published 'The Stainless Steel Kat saves a Hack
				writer from bankruptcy yet again'), but he did send a games
				book of what would have happened if he did. The talks were a
				sheer pleasure from George Lucas's 'A Switch in Time and I'll
				make Nine (Episodes)' and '101 Depraved Things to do with an
				Ewok or the Seamier Side of Star Wars'. I've always wondered
				about certain names - Hans Solo, Leia Organa - well now I know.
				IC SF won the Science Fiction charades despite getting
				'XLYSBRHJCLLY The Unpronouncable' as one title. Their opponents
				were stumped by '-' a little know work by the Swedish 17th
				century proto-sf writer Otto Bold. Live roleplaying was much in
				evidence but due to the failure of TTALT (Treasure Trap Arms
				Limitation Talks) several more headless bodies were transported
				to the bowels of Life Sci, were hoards of gibbering failed
				doctors were unleashed to practice their art. However wholesale
				slaughter was stopped by the banning of Thanganive the
				Inscrutable's fireball when Chemistry refused to let him sign
				for twenty litres of napalm. Arthur C Clark sent us a telegram
				of congratulations which he then denied he ever sent (see
				his forthcoming series of 'Arthur C Clark's Mysterious
				Messages'). So with fond memories of Piconon 1 I am
				completely confident that Picocon one-vee will surpass even
				its greatest heights.

			<p>
				PS Picocon one-vee will take place on Saturday 15th Feb and will
				start at 10am (it will be repeated via a time-warp in
				1857).

				<b>NB: Dave Clements notes that this article contains a very
				specific typo - for Picocon 1, read Picocon i.  This makes a lot
				more sense, really.</b>
