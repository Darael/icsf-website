			<h3>What's it all About?</h3>

			<p>
				As an ardent SF fan, people frequently ask me certain questions
				(well maybe not, but it's one way to start an article. The most
				common of these goes along the lines of 'Why do you like
				reading all that juvenile stuff about Bug Eyed Green Monsters
				and silly ray guns?' I usually have two answers for this
				question. One is very short, consisting of two words, one of
				which is 'off'. Since this reply would not improve our image
				among the esteemed readers of this publication I shall now
				resort to my second, longer answer.
			</p>

			<p>
				SF (not sci-fi, an abbreviation all time fans loathe) as we
				know it today has its roots in two very different places.
				The one most people think of is the 'pulp' American magazine
				of the thirties and forties, famous for what many people now
				associate with Science fiction - bug eyed monsters, ray guns,
				phallic spaceships and all that. Indeed it is the ghost of
				the pulps that still haunts us. The other form of proto-SF
				is the much more respectable 'Science Romances' of H G Wells,
				Olaf Stapledon and other Englishmen of the period between the
				World Wars. Their tales were far more intellectually
				stimulating and of much greater literary ability. They dealt
				with real questions of political, philosophical or human
				interest. Wells' <em>The Time Machine</em> or Stapledon's
				<em>Last and First Men</em> are prime examples. Indeed the
				latter is still regarded by many as being both the finest SF
				ever written and the best piece of literature to come out of
				England between the wars.

			<p>
				What became of these English bastions of SF literature? Well,
				they died. For many years all the SF that remained was in the
				style of American pulp. At this point, in the 40's and 50's
				Hollywood got hold of pulpish SF and filmed it, producing what
				most people think of as the archetypical SF film - distinctive
				features being bad story, cheap effects, lack of
				characterization, totally unorganised etc. etc.
			</p>

			<p>
				However, while Hollywood was butchering SF's public image, the
				writers were getting their act together and producing some
				decent stuff. In the US such authors as Silverberg, Pohl,
				Sheckley, and Leiber started to drag SF up from the sorry state
				it was in. Then in the 60's, England the so called New Wave
				authors, like Moorcock, Aldiss and Ballard started producing
				work which was as good or better than contemporary literature.
				J G Ballard last year nearly won the Booker Prize, and Mike
				Moorcock has been praised so highly by modern critics that
				you'd think he was the greatest living writer. Some people
				might agree.

			<p>
				Since then the ghetto walls surrounding SF have continued to
				fall, and it is no longer a separate and 'worthless' art form.
				It's a pity the film makers and TV producers still think they
				live in the so called <i>Golden Age</i> of SF, whe EE 'Doc'
				Smith spaceships ruled the subspace lanes and Q-beams fried
				the vile slimy aliens, the days when men were men and women
				did what they were told.
			</p>

			<p>
				These days are over, and SF is set to conquer the literary
				universe!

				The other question I'm frequently asked this time of year, (and
				this one isn't just a way of getting an article going) is
				'what's happening at <b>PICOCON</b>? For those of you who don'
				know, <b>PICOCON</b> is SF SOC's own mini-convention. This is a
				gathering of people interested in SF (though that's not
				obligatory) to see SF Films, hear speakers (authors or
				generally interesting people) and play competitions of a
				generally SF nature. One thing we're doing this year, which we
				are especially pleased about, is showing videos of old TV
				programmes. SF on televisions is occasionally very well done,
				and almost always disappears once you've seen it, never to
				return again. Also, since many people were first introduced
				to Science Fiction by television, they have pleasant memories
				of TV programs from their youth. At <b>PICOCON</b> and a
				secret event planned later this term, you'll get to see some
				of your favourite TV Science Fiction. So, without further ado,
				here is the <b>PICOCON</b> timetable. Oh and another thing,
				<b>PICOCON 4</b> is on all day Saturday 15th Feb in the Union
				Dining Hall and SCR. It starts at 10am and continues for at
				least 12 hours at the bargain price of &pound;2.50. Here is
				the programme of events, hope to see you there.
