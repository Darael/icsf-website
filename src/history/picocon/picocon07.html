			<h2>Picocon 7 - 1989</h2>
			<p>
				The guests for this Picocon were <b>Dave Langford</b>,
				<b>Terry Pratchett</b>, <b>Gerry Webb</b> and
				<b>Dave Lally</b>.... according to one source.
				According to the Felix article, it was <b>Bob Shaw</b> not
				<b>Gerry Webb</b>. Ah well.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to <b>Simon Bradshaw</b> "It went wrong.
				Actually it probably went ok, but owing to various hassles it
				was a big panic behind the scenes." (sounds familiar)
			</p>
			<p>
				There was also a talk from the Amateur Rocketry Group,
				wargaming (Paranoia and Space:1889) and videos all day.
