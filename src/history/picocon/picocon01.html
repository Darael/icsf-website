			<h2>Picocon - 1984</h2>

			<p>
				Claimed to have such delights as <em>Thunderbird 6</em>,
				Call My Bluff and talks from <em>Dave Langford</em> and
				the "Renowned SF personality <em>
				<a href="http://www.science-com.concatenation.org">Jonathan Cowie</a></em>".
			</p>

			<p>
				What actual history documentation we have for the first formal
				Picocon comes from a <a href="picocon04/felix_picocon4_preview_picocon1_report.html">review
				in Felix</a>, which was published in the run up to Picocon 4 -
				although some have raised concerns over the factual accuracy
				of this document.
			</p>

			<p>
				More recently, it has been suggested that the jump from Picocon
				Picocon Pi (which, we assume, was to be '3') and the to Picocon
				4 might be explained by the fact there were two events that
				were referred to as Picocon - one a day of films and gaming in
				someone's flat, and the other (which would then logically be
				Picocon 2), this original convention that starts Picocon as we
				now know it.
