<p><b>Dave Clements</b> was ICSF chair when <b>Brian Stableford</b> came to Picocon, along with the ever present <b>Dave Langford</b>. <i>Blade Runner</i> and a UFO episode were shown, and ICSF and CUSFS battled it out in a 2-round quiz.</p>

<p>"One thing we're doing this year, which we are especially pleased about, is showing videos of old TV programmes. 
SF on televisions is occasionally very well done, and almost always disappears once you've seen it, never to return again. 
Also, since many people were first introduced to Science Fiction by television, they have pleasant memories of TV programs 
from their youth. At <b>PICOCON</b> and a secret event planned later this term, you'll get to see some of your favourite 
TV Science Fiction. So, without further ado, here is the <b>PICOCON</b> timetable. Oh and another thing, <b>PICOCON 4</b> 
is on all day Saturday 15th Feb in the Union Dining Hall and SCR. It starts at 10am and continues for at least 12 hours 
at the bargain price of &pound;2.50. Here is the programme of events, hope to see you there."</p>
