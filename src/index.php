		<p>
			ICSF is the centre for science fiction, fantasy and horror fans at
			Imperial College. We run a library of over 7000 books and 1000 DVDs
			and videos from all corners of the genre. Whether your interest is
			Pratchett's 'Discworld', 'The Sandman' graphic novels or 'Stargate'
			this is an ideal way to indulge it! And a great place to pick up new
			and exciting obsessions too!
		</p>
		<p>
			The social side of the society is
			equally active - the library is open every lunchtime on weekdays and
			we have regular video showings (often weird or esoteric stuff you
			should have seen but won't have). Barnights are on Thursdays, these
			are often frequented by past members of the society. We also run
			events like mass outings to the cinema and end of term dinners.
		</p>
		<p>
			The
			largest event of the year is Picocon, our one-day convention held in
			February, which usually attracts around 200 attendees.
		</p>
		<p>
			In all, being
			a member is a lot of fun and a great way to make new friends who are
			interested in SF or fantasy.
			Interested?  We can be found in our purpose built library in the
			West Wing Basement of Beit Quad (the Students Union building),
			opposite Stoic TV. For more detailed instructions, see the
			instructions here.
