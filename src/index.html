			ICSF is the centre for science fiction, fantasy and horror fans at
			Imperial College. We run a library of over 9000 books and 1800 DVDs
			and videos from all corners of the genre. Whether your interest is
			Pratchett's 'Discworld', 'The Sandman' graphic novels or 'Stargate'
			this is an ideal way to indulge it! And a great place to pick up new
			and exciting obsessions too!
		</p>
		<p>
			The social side of the society is equally active - the
			<a href="<!--SRVROOT-->/library/">library</a> is open every
			lunchtime on weekdays and we have regular video showings
			(often weird or esoteric stuff you should have seen but won't
			have).
			Barnights are on Thursdays, these are often frequented by past
			members of the society.
			We also run events like mass outings to the cinema and end
			of term dinners; you can see what is coming up on the
			<a href="<!--SRVROOT-->/events/">events page</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The
			largest event of the year is <a href="<!--SRVROOT-->/picocon/">Picocon</a>,
			our one-day convention held in February, which usually attracts around 200 attendees.
		</p>
		<p>
			In all, being
			a member is a lot of fun and a great way to make new friends who are
			interested in SF or fantasy.
			Interested?  We can be found in our purpose built library in the
			West Wing Basement of Beit Quad (the Students Union building),
			opposite Stoic TV. Click for <a
			href="<!--SRVROOT-->/library/getting-to.html">directions to the library</a>.
