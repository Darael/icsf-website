		<h2>The Imperial Steampunk Society</h2>
		<p>
			Founded in late 2013, the steampunk society caters to Imperial's large community of tea drinking, top hat wearing goggle aficionados; otherwise known as steampunks.
      We organise trips, socials and other events; and aim to provide a meeting point for anyone with an interest in the subculture.
		</p>

		<h3>Contacting Steampunk</h3>
		<p>
			Most steampunk activity takes place on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/icsps/">Facebook page</a>;
      we also have a <a href="https://mailman.ic.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/icu-steampunks">mailing list</a> for disseminating <strike>propaganda</strike> information. 
      To contact the person who is nominally in charge, you can email <a href="mailto:icsf.steampunk@gmail.com">icsf.steampunk@gmail.com</a>
      Our carrier pigeon service is still under development.

    <h3>Steampunk Resources</h3>
    <p>
      Apart from the society itself, the internet has a few good resources for those interested in the subculture. 
      Chief among these is <a href="http://brassgoggles.co.uk/forum/">Brass Goggles</a>, a large and friendly forum frequented by several Society members.
      For those looking to join other IRL groups, there is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/139909556032928/"> British Steampunk Community</a> Facebook group, and the <a href="http://www.britishsteampunk.org/">Victorian Steampunk Society</a> (organisers of The Asylum, the UK's biggest Steampunk event) maintain a website.
      Finally, the Society maintains good relations with Southampton University's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/184948814914233/?fref=ts"> Krakensoc</a>, and regularly runs joint events with them.
