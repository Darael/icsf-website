= Freshers Fair in October
- Due to the positioning of the new library a stand in the quad should be pressed for
 - ACTION: Jakob to pressure union.
- As last year a bookcase(?) of seconds will be present to give away.
- The Daleks should be on display to give a more 'sci-fi' feel.
- Once people seem vaguely interested they should be dragged down into the library and shown around - hence people needed in library and on stand.
- There should be stuff going on in the library and the people on the stand should know what 'stuff' is.
- Two 'leaflets' a wyrmtongue for those who seem very interested and a flyer for their friends.
- A sign up sheet is a needed - Name, Year, email, Dept.
 - email can then be guessed or worked out if not known.
- Slightly later on flyers pasted around in halls. See also Femtocon, First Wyrmtongue
