<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Well that went rather well&rdquo;.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Thanks to Alex<FONT SIZE=3> for being
sofa this year.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>More thank you's:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br />
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.43cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>To
Jon, our Beanbag, for clinching important internal arrangements.<br /><br />To
Tim, because he is a fine steward of sweet, sweet cash.<br /><br />To
Becca and Peter for obtaining the computers for the LAN, an
expenditure of considerable effort and time.<br /><br />To Ian, Owain and
Baz for running the LAN on the day, and to everyone who donated
machines for this purpose.<br /><br />To Daniel, for excellent publicity
work.<br /><br />To Smithers, for superb artwork, a great Picocon
Wyrmtongue and sorting out the T-shirts.<br /><br />To Ben, for
auctioneering at a record-breaking open-air DoDM.<br /><br />To Alban,
for obtaining the dewar and liquid nitrogen, so that those offended
by the items on offer could receive . . . cold comfort.<br /><br />To
everyone who lost their fiscal sanity at the aforementioned DoDM.<br /><br />To
Dave Clements for compering the Turkey Readings and Silly Games. (I
couldn't make it along to these, but I gather they were a success. I
have heard terrified mutterings about Black Mayonnaise and gigglings
about the fact that hitting Peter counts as a noisemaker . . .)<br /><br />To
everyone who took part in Turkey Readings and the Silly Games.<br /><br />To
Ed (Adventure! Ed or the Hairless Bastard to some), for championing
our noble institution in the fish duel that didn't happen, and
trouting . . . sorry, I mean trouncing his opponent 6-1.<br /><br />To
Cristina, for undergoing re-entry from Space Holland to attend
Picocon and being generally useful.<br /><br />To LOTS OF PEOPLE for
manning the front desk, doing Huxley Door duty, helping clear up,
lifting various Stuff (and some Things), propping up the bar
(*cough*Kai, Owain, Kath*cough*), watching me host a panel discussion
under the influence of three pints, and otherwise holding Picocon
together!<br /><br />To everyone who made significant contributions that
I nevertheless forgot to mention: may you never take your revenge! </FONT>

expensive, still made over &pound;100 more than last year.</P>
<P>Around 180 people attended</P>
<P>Breakdown of Budget enclosed.</P>
<P>&pound;100 of change should have been enough, but Tim's law of
change acted, extra &pound;40 was found during the day. &pound;100
should be enough next year, this year was very popular.</P>
