= Events:
- Freshers’ Fair went very well.
 - However, it is pointed out that more people need to be sent down to the library to see it during this time.
 - It is proposed to have free books in the library next time and signs pointing to them to lure in more people.
 - It is suggested that we consider having a greater presence in the quad, and more posters pointing to the library.
 - The loss of Mathew Parker as an advertising tool is greatly lamented.
- Some sort of ‘West Basement open day’ is once again suggested in order to draw in members to all the west basement societies.
 - ACT: This will be brought up at the next Media group meeting and the other groups in the basement will be spoken to.
> [18:17] Ethel Bardsley (Tech Priest)
- The Meet & Greet was also a success.
 - Need more space in the library, as we now get large amounts of members.
 - The possibility of installing some sort of moving shelves is brought up.
 - Further investigation into this is required.
 - Also pointed out that there is a lot of clutter in the library
 - ACT: The library will be cleaned up and tidied.
 - Further re-shuffling and re-arranging of stock needs further discussion in the future.
- Tea Duelling event also went well; reports Steampunk.
 - Next time a bigger space will be required.
 - It is also pointed out that a bigger Tea vessel will be required.
 - It is proposed that the structure be revised somehow, in particular so that those who lose in the first round are not then out of commission for the whole event.
 - ACT: Ways to expand the event will be looked into.
- It is also suggested that some sort of noticeboard be set up in the library to advertise events and steampunk events.
 - It is pointed out we have a perfectly good whiteboard just lying around doing nothing.
- We are informed the Barnight also went well.
 - This was despite the Union somehow managing to lose our table bookings.
 - The night was actually slightly under-budget.
 - ACT: Next time when making a booking the manager will be told how they messed up last time; to put additionally pressure on them not to repeat their mistake.
- The Halloween booking has been erased
 - ACT: Enquiries will be made as to whether we can have alcohol in the library because of this. Noor will email Alex McKee and the DCPS about this.
 - The viewing schedule will be determined by the Chair of Vice, but can be changed by popular demand.
 - It is concluded that having any dancing fluids in the library would be a bad idea.
- Seeing as the Chair of Vice has been working overtime; it is suggested that she delegate some tasks.
- An Ice-skating event is proposed given the success of last year’s trip.
- A Christmas viewing will also be held.
- It is pointed out that the Hobbit cinema trip and Christmas viewings currently clash, as both are tentatively scheduled for the last Friday of term.
 - As the Hobbit releases the week before, it is decided to reschedule that film trip to be before the Christmas viewing.
- There is a small Pen explosion.
 - Napkins are deployed.
- The bookcrawl on 18/10/2014 has been fully planned.
 - A list of stock to buy for the library also exists.
- It is suggested that there be joint excursion to MCM in conjunction with Anime society at some point in the future.
- There is a suggestion for a Steampunk event; a concert by ‘The Men that will not be blown for nothing.’
- It is also pointed out that the BFI is having a Sci Fi season.
 - ACT: This will be investigated further.
- A Sci-Fi karaoke night is proposed.
 - ACT: Amanda will look into this.

 - 12.19 FF snacks.
 - 120 Publicity.

> [19:02] Henry Leventhorpe
- We have only received 53% of our grant so far because we have only reached 53% of our expected membership for the year.
 - There is no need to worry as this sum will go up as more people join throughout the year.
- We are informed by the Treasurer that all is well with the budget.
- Steampunk requests a figure for their budget.
 - ACT: Steampunk will come up with an estimate for how much will need, and we will go from there.
- It is enquired as to whether there can be a separate Union product for Steampunk membership.
 - This has been looked into and it turns out that you cannot have free products on the Union website.
 - It is suggested that Steampunk charge the minimum amount for their membership and that this contributes to their budget.
> [19:12] Benedict Harcourt
= Database and Archiving:
- It is pointed out that the database is currently non-functional; as well as dated.
- Purchasing or constructing a new database is suggested.
 - It is pointed out that Anime is currently planning to build a similar database for their stock.
 - It is suggested that we collaborate with them on this, so that we can both use structurally identical, though separate databases.
 - ACT: Ethel will talk to Anime society about this.
- The archiving of the society’s old materials is once again brought up.
 - It is pointed out that this is a long project, potentially as much as 5 years.
 - As such it is suggested that perhaps a new position should be created to manage the archive.
 - A book of Picocon artwork entries is also proposed.
= Duty Librarians:
- As the librarian cannot be present on Thursdays, a duty librarian will be required.
 - ACT: Sanchit agrees to do this.
= Amending of Standing Orders:
- ACT: Amanda will examine the standing orders and constitution in order to see how the no alcohol rule can be best integrated.
= Any other business:
- ACT: It is decided to wait until next summer to re-carpet the library. 
- It is pointed out that the handheld vacuum cleaner is malfunction.
 - ACT: It is decided that the society will purchase a new one.
- ACT: We will also ask for a new bin from the Union.
